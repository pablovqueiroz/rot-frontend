## Application Routes

### Public Routes

| Route | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | HomePage | Landing page with provider listing and search |
| `/login` | Login | User/provider login page |
| `/register` | Register | New user/provider registration |
| `/about` | AboutPage | Information about the platform |
| `/providers/:id` | ProviderDetails | Detailed provider information and services |

### Client (User) Routes

| Route | Component | Description | Access |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `/user/profile` | UserProfilePage | Client profile management | Authenticated |
| `/booking` | Booking | Appointment booking flow | Authenticated |
| `/calendar` | Calendar | Client appointment calendar | Authenticated |
| `/my-appointments` | Appointments | View and manage scheduled appointments | Authenticated |

| `/provider/calendar` | ProviderCalendar | Provider schedule management | Authenticated (Provider) |
| `/provider/services` | MyServices | Create and manage services | Authenticated (Provider) |

| `*` | NotFound | 404 page not found |

## Frontend Architecture

### Design Patterns

- **Page-Based Architecture**: Each route corresponds to a full-page component
- **Component-Based UI**: Reusable, modular components for consistent styling and behavior
- **Context API**: Global state management for authentication and theme
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated logic for calendar and other features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with flexible layouts

### State Management

- **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication, login status, and current user data
- **ThemeContext**: Handles dark/light theme preferences and persistence
- **Component State**: Local state for form inputs, loading states, and UI interactions

### Styling Architecture

- **Global Styles**: Base styles and CSS resets in `src/styles/`
- **CSS Variables**: Theme colors and typography defined in `variables.css`
- **Component Scoped Styles**: Each component has its own CSS file for maintainability
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries for optimal desktop and mobile experiences

### Data Flow

```
Components/Pages → API Service (Axios) → Backend API
                  ↓
            Context (State Management)
                  ↓
           Local Storage (Auth Token, Preferences)
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Backend API running (see backend repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rot-right-on-time-frontend.git
cd rot-right-on-time-frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5005/api
```

Adjust the API URL based on your backend server configuration.

### Development Server

Start the development server with hot module replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates optimized static files in the `dist/` directory.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Code Linting

Check code quality and styling:

```bash
npm run lint
```



Authentication context is managed by `AuthContext`, wrapping the app to provide global auth state.

## Key Features

- **Authentication**: Login and registration for users and providers.
- **Provider Listings**: View available providers.
- **Provider Details**: Detailed information about a specific provider.
- **Booking**: Schedule appointments with providers.
- **Calendars**: View events and availability.
- **Profile Management**: Edit profiles for users and providers.
- **Service Management**: For providers, manage offered services.

## Backend Integration

The application communicates with a backend API for operations like authentication, provider search, bookings, etc. Frontend routes map to backend API endpoints.

### API Base URL Configuration

Set the backend API URL in your environment:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5005/api
```

### Image Flow

Image uploads are done in two steps:

1. Upload image: `POST /api/upload/image`
2. Associate image: `PUT /api/users/image` or `PUT /api/providers/image`

Images are sent as JSON objects containing `url` and `public_id`.

### Key API Endpoints

- **Authentication**: `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/verify`
- **Providers**: `GET /providers`, `GET /providers/:id`, `PUT /providers/me`
- **Users**: `GET /users/me`, `PUT /users/me`
- **Appointments**: `GET /appointments`, `POST /appointments`, `PUT /appointments/:id`, `DELETE /appointments/:id`
- **Services**: `GET /services`, `POST /services`, `PUT /services/:id`, `DELETE /services/:id`
- **Images**: `POST /upload/image`

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API for:

- User authentication and authorization
- Provider and service data retrieval
- Appointment creation, retrieval, and management
- User and provider profile operations
- File uploads for avatars and images

### Important Rules

- Frontend routes are not identical to backend routes; they map user flows.
- Image uploads are always a separate request.
- Signup routes never receive files directly.
- All API calls include JWT authentication headers when required.
